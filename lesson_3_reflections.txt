when would you want to creat a remote repository than rather than keeping all you work local?
    =>因為存在網路上，這樣我就可以很簡單的使用不同的平台協作或是跟他人合作，而且因為有線上備份，對於資料安全多了一分保障

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    =>其實跟之前在本機端使用git自動存取的想法差不多，如果是定時或隔幾行就自動存，這樣存儲的版本意義就不大，變成只是可以回朔的大量儲存而已
      所以手動控制，在自己認為適當的時機commit才是相對比較好的選擇。
